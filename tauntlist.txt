481. This is the People's War. It is our war. We are the fighters. Fight it then! Fight it with all that is in us and may God defend the Right.
482. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.
483. Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.
484. You're a little scary sometimes, you know that. Brilliant, but scary.
485. All I want is a friend!
486. Now throw the switch and let us begin the battle for the planet!

494. I swear I will not kill anyone.
495. It's Showtime!
496. Let the attack begin.
497. There will be no order, only chaos.
498. Now there's another thing I want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We're not holding anything. Let the Hun do that. We are advancing constantly and we're not interested in holding onto anything except the enemy! We're going to hold onto him by the nose and we're going to kick him in the ass! We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose!
499. Everything is in readiness, master. We merely await your word.

507. Jesus, you were going to kill that guy! –Of course. I'm a Terminator.
508. All right, I'll take point, you two flank. Let's triangulate. –Equilateral or isosceles?
509. *Trumpet*
510. Try not! Do. Or do not. There is no 'try.'
511. You have a destiny, and now is your time to fulfill it.
512. Now let's see how destructive you are without your war weapons!
513. Hey, come on, we're superheroes. What could happen?
514. Now remember, I do my best work when I'm being worshipped as a god
515. Your assistance would be welcomed.
516. Thanks for your support.
517. We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast. The German news agency Transoceanic said today in a broadcast that the Allied invasion had begun. I repeat: “The German news agency, transoceanic, said today in a broadcast that the Allied invasion had begun.” There was no Allied confirmation.
518. Get someone else to do your dirty work!
519. Help!!! Somebody… Help!!!
520. How can you two just sit there and watch this happen?
521. You mean it's like 'if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.' –Yes. –I thought so.
522. Important assignment! (click) Important assignment!
523. So, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.

544. Then let's go where the action is!
545. His name is MacGyver. He can fix anything. He could fix a computer with a hairpin and a piece of duct tape.
546. Oh, who did this to you? This is just not right. In fact, it's nasty...
547. What in Judas-Rocking-Priest is going on around here?!?
548. This damn well better be worth it. Because if this story of yours turns out to be bogus, I'm going to kill you twice. Now you got that?

562. Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers?
563. (gong) You rang?
564. You have made me very angry, very angry indeed!
565. It is an honor to protect my country and my family.
566. Well, now don't you bet your life on it.
567. So far, this is not blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.
568. You shall not pass!
569. Danger is over...
570. Don't make me destroy you!
571. Everything is back to normal. I-I think… I think I can go back to trying to destroy the world again.

574. Who disturbs my slumber?
575. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over.
576. I wouldn’t do that if I were you…
577. I don't know who you are, where you're from, or what you want... but if you threaten my freedom, I'll kill you.
578. Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.
579. I don’t bloody believe it!
580. Let me assert my firm belief… that the only thing we have to fear is… fear itself.
581. Please, I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak! Well, maybe you do.
582. All right, you ground-pounders, if it's fighting you want then you're about to get your share.
583. You think you’ve got what it takes?!?
584. I take that back. This is real bad
585. Huh? It's you?!?
586. Oh! I wouldn't do that. I really wouldn't.
587. Killing me won't help you.
588. You do that and I'll kill ya.
589. *Cartoon sound of running away*
590. Run for your lives!
591. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!
592. Slower n' molasses in January...
593. What are you doing in my swamp?
594. There is a weapons deactivator in effect here. Your destructive machines will have no effect.
595. No problemo!
596. Get off my land!!!
597. Well, I don't know about you, but I am planning to scream and run.

613. OK, the battle is yours, Raymond. But it's just one battle in a huge, battly, war–thing with lots of other battles.
614. Be gone, evil one!
615. Ooh! Aah! That was really scary! And if you don't mind me saying, if that don't work your breath will certainly get the job done because you definitely need some Tic-Tacs or something because your breath stinks!!!
616. Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.
617. I'm just afraid that you're going to burn in Hell for all this.
618. What a filthy job! –Could be worse. –How? –Could be raining... (thunder)
619. Look into my crystal ball to see your future... -This is not going to work cow... -Please big brother... concentrate!

627. We're going down, Captain!
628. All you can do at a time like this is just hang on until the scenery changes.
629. Oh, boy, what a hangover!
630. Must one person's triumph be another's humiliation? -Of course.
631. (*crying*) I'm a failure…
632. Oh, don't look at me! I'm a mess!
633. I must save myself. But what can I do?!?

640. Well… Yeh… Ok… That’s just about the most awful thing I’ve ever seen.
641. Don't move until it opens fire, then move fast!
642. You're acting like this is all my fault.
643. Oh, heh heh heh, my mistake.
644. I think I need a hug.
645. Never give up, never surrender!
646. This is important. The race is not yet over!
647. I'm not finished yet!
648. Oh, no, not again! Oh my! Oh my! Oh, my goodness gracious!
649. Oh, this is one of those days which the pages of history teach us are best spent lying in bed.
650. Oh, that'll teach me to say please.

676. Don't make me come over there!
677. Get back to work, you slacker.
678. It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum... and I'm all outta gum.
679. We can teach these barbarians a lesson in Western methods and efficiency that will put them to shame. We'll show them what the British soldier is capable of doing.
680. Hey! This promises to be fun!
681. Leave me alone, geek-boy!
682. I'm just an untalented old has-been. -Were you ever famous? -No. -Then how can you be a has-been?

729. Oh, my god! My eyes! Oh, my eyes!
730. We're on a mission, you nit!
731. This is an extremely primitive and paranoid culture.
732. You're useless and pathetic, like a useless and pathetic thing.
733. You might want to practice a little more…
734. Losers always whine about 'their best'. Winners go home and ♥♥♥♥ the prom queen.
735. Are you going to pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?
736. So, how did you do, ♥♥♥♥♥-boy?
737. And one more thing… The next time you talk to me like that, I'm going to rip you a new butthole so big you can be able to take a cannon up your ass.
738. I was being sarcastic, which is another big word you'll learn in school. But you wouldn't know that considering you've never attended one of this country's great educational facilities, which is a thought that just sickens me.
739. Silence, you mental midget!
740. All right, you're going the right way for a smacked bottom.
741. That is the weirdest thing you have ever said.

790. Boy, oh boy, you got a knack for getting yourself out of trouble.
791. Laugh while you can, monkey-boy!
792. Ya screw with the bull, ya get the horn!
793. My head hurts, my feet stink and I don't love Jesus!
794. I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
795. You do and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush popper!
796. You're mocking me, aren't you?
797. Maybe that'll learn ya to keep your big mouth shut!
798. Oh, that is nasty!
799. What do you think this is?!? A zoo?!?
800. I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with. Nobody tells me what to do in my place.
801. Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of cricket!
802. There is no terror in your threats.
803. Don't bother responding. We're not listening.
804. Oh, really?!?
805. You know, we have to work on your people skills.
806. I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
807. Yeah, I could use some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ poontang, myself, right now.
808. The answers to these questions, and more, on next week's episode of Who Gives A Rat's Ass.
809. I said get over here boy!

812. You’re crazy!
813. Take your best shot.
814. I think you're nuts, but this isn't the best time to argue.

816. Tsk, tsk. –Yeah, tsk. –And another tsk!
817. Oh, poor baby…
818. Bring it on!
819. Well, if that is the worst thing that happens today, I'll be thrilled.
820. It’s a lie…the evidence have been falsified. I never broke the law, I am the law!
821. That is the weirdest thing you have ever said.
822. What the hell are you talking about?!?
823. (scream) What was that?!?
824. Who gives a ♥♥♥♥?!?
825. I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered!

827. What's going to happen? Something wonderful…
828. All your base are belong to us!
829. And now, you die!
830. The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

834. Hands up, son!
835. They’re a bunch of cowards!
836. This is too easy!!!
837. It's time to start running!
838. Strength is irrelevant. Resistance is futile. We wish to improve ourselves. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service ours.
839. Freedom is irrelevant. Self-determination is irrelevant. You must comply.
840. Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!
841. It is done imperious leader.
842. The choice is yours: obey me and live, or disobey and die.
843. Well, you're just in time for what might be a very unhappy ending.
844. The entire world will beg to bow before me, their charismatic despot!
845. There is no escape…
846. Don't tell me you didn't see that coming...
847. Ooo, that's gotta hurt!
848. Heh, heh, heh. What a mess!
849. Why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer, ha ha!
850. Gentlemen, I give you the future.
851. Hmm. Blah-blah-blah...
852. So you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!
853. At last, victory is mine!
854. I told you people to leave me alone… I told you to beat it!
855. Well, there's a lesson for you...
856. Let that be a lesson to the two of you little…
857. Die you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!
858. We're all here to do what we're all here to do.
859. Ooh, busted!

871. This conversation can serve no purpose anymore, goodbye.
872. I'd like to thank all the little people I stepped on to get where I am today.
873. Uh, l-let's pretend like this never happened.
